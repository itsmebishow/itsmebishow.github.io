In programming, this means that a small fraction of concepts or skills will provide the majority of the value in your work or learning process.</p> </li> <li> <p>How to apply: Identify the 20% of skills or concepts that will have the greatest impact on your programming success. For example:</p> <pre><code>  -   In a new programming language or framework, focus on mastering the most commonly used features, libraries, or patterns (such as understanding data structures in Python or core concepts in React).\n\n  -   Instead of trying to learn everything about a new framework, ==focus on the most frequently used functionality== (e.g., mastering state management in React or mastering queries in SQL).\n\n  -   Focus on problem-solving techniques or concepts that show up most in coding interviews or real-world applications (e.g., recursion, algorithms, APIs).\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Benefit: Saves time and resources by directing your efforts toward the most impactful and relevant areas. This allows you to be productive quickly and solve practical problems with minimal learning time.</p> </li> </ul> Example of Applying the 80/20 Principle in Learning: <ul> <li> <p>If you're learning JavaScript, instead of trying to understand every single detail of the language, you could focus on the 20% of features that will be the most useful across most projects:</p> <ul> <li>Functions, closures, and callbacks.</li> <li>Array methods (map, filter, reduce).</li> <li>Promises and async/await.</li> <li>Basic understanding of ES6 features (let/const, destructuring, spread/rest).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Mastering just these concepts will likely allow you to work on most JavaScript projects effectively, covering 80% of what you\u2019ll need to know in most situations.</p> </li> </ul> Combining It All: <ul> <li> <p>80/20 + The Feynman Technique: Focus on the most critical concepts using the 80/20 rule, then teach those concepts using the Feynman Technique to ensure you truly understand them.</p> </li> <li> <p>80/20 + Deliberate Practice: Identify the core skills that will benefit you most and engage in deliberate practice by targeting these high-value areas.</p> </li> <li> <p>80/20 + Pomodoro Technique: Apply the 80/20 rule to narrow your focus, then break that down into Pomodoro sessions to stay productive and focused on the most critical learning.</p> </li> <li> <p>80/20 + Spaced Repetition: Focus your spaced repetition on the key programming concepts that offer the greatest value (according to the 80/20 rule) to retain them for the long term.</p> </li> </ul> <p>By combining the 80/20 Principle with the other strategies, you can ensure that you\u2019re focusing on the most important aspects of your learning while also making sure that you retain that knowledge and apply it effectively in real-world situations.</p> <p>80/20 + Spaced Repetition</p> <p>Absolutely! The combination of the 80/20 Principle and Spaced Repetition is a powerful strategy for long-term retention of the most critical programming concepts. Here's how you can approach it:</p> <p>Step 1: Identify the 20% of Concepts (80/20 Rule)</p> <p>First, you need to identify which 20% of programming concepts are most essential to your growth or project success. These concepts should be those that appear frequently or are highly applicable across a variety of projects.</p> <p>Let's break down some key programming concepts to focus on:</p> Example Programming Concepts (for a general programming context): <ul> <li> <p>Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees, Graphs</p> </li> <li> <p>Algorithms: Sorting (QuickSort, MergeSort), Searching (Binary Search), Recursion, Dynamic Programming</p> </li> <li> <p>Coding Patterns: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), MVC (Model-View-Controller)</p> </li> <li> <p>Language-Specific Constructs: Functions, Closures, Promises (JavaScript), Classes &amp; Objects (OOP), Lambdas (Python, JavaScript)</p> </li> <li> <p>Frameworks**: React Hooks, State Management (Redux or Context API for React), REST APIs</p> </li> <li> <p>Version Control: Git basics (commit, push, pull, branches)</p> </li> <li> <p>Database Queries: SQL basics (SELECT, INSERT, JOIN)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Step 2: Create a Spaced Repetition Schedule for These Key Concepts</p> <p>Once you've identified these core concepts, you can structure your spaced repetition to ensure these are reviewed at increasing intervals. Here\u2019s a basic framework for how spaced repetition works:</p> Spaced Repetition Intervals: <ul> <li> <p>Day 1: Review the material the same day you learn it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Day 2\u20133: Review the material again within 2\u20133 days to reinforce your memory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Day 7: Review it after about a week.</p> </li> <li> <p>Day 14: Review it after about two weeks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Day 30: Review it after a month.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Tools for Spaced Repetition:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use apps like Anki, Quizlet, or Memrise to create digital flashcards and schedule your spaced repetition sessions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alternatively, you could use a paper-based or digital notebook to mark the days when you need to revisit certain concepts.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Step 3: Create Flashcards for Key Concepts</p> <p>For the spaced repetition to work, you need questions/flashcards that focus on the most essential concepts identified by the 80/20 rule. Here are examples of flashcards for some of the concepts:</p> Flashcards for Core Programming Concepts: <p>1.  Data Structures:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: What is the time complexity of inserting an element into a hash table?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: O(1) on average (with proper hashing and minimal collisions).</p> </li> </ul> <p>2  Algorithms:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: What is the difference between MergeSort and QuickSort?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: MergeSort is O(n log n) in all cases, while QuickSort has an average time complexity of O(n log n) but a worst-case time complexity of O(n\u00b2).</p> </li> </ul> <p>3.  JavaScript Concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: What is a closure in JavaScript, and why is it useful?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: A closure is a function that remembers its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope. It's useful for data encapsulation and private variables.</p> </li> </ul> <p>4.  React Concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: How does the useEffect hook work in React?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: <code>useEffect</code> is used to perform side effects in function components. It runs after the render and can be used to fetch data, update the DOM, or subscribe to external events.</p> </li> </ul> <p>5.  Version Control (Git):</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: What is the difference between git merge and git rebase?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: <code>git merge</code> combines two branches, keeping the history of both branches. <code>git rebase</code> rewrites the history by applying the changes from one branch onto another, creating a cleaner, linear history.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Step 4: Use Spaced Repetition to Continuously Reinforce These Concepts</p> <p>For each concept, set up a spaced repetition system that asks you to review key topics at the intervals I mentioned above.</p> <p>For instance, if you\u2019re using Anki (a popular tool for spaced repetition):</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create Flashcards: Add flashcards with key questions about the most important programming concepts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Review Regularly: The app will show you these flashcards in intervals based on how well you\u2019ve remembered them. Initially, you\u2019ll review frequently, but as you remember them better, the app will increase the interval.</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus on Weak Areas: If you keep forgetting a particular concept (e.g., binary search algorithm), the spaced repetition tool will prioritize that concept until it sticks.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Example of a Spaced Repetition Schedule Using Anki:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Day 1 (Learning): You learn about Binary Search. Create flashcards:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: What is the time complexity of Binary Search?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: O(log n) for sorted arrays.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Day 2 (First Review): You review Binary Search. You remember it well.</p> </li> <li> <p>Day 7 (Second Review): You review it again a week later. You remember it but need a little prompting.</p> </li> <li> <p>Day 14 (Third Review): Review again in two weeks. At this point, it should be well-memorized.</p> </li> <li> <p>Day 30 (Fourth Review): Review it after a month. You\u2019ll likely remember it without much effort.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Combining 80/20 and Spaced Repetition in Practice:</p> <p>By focusing on the 20% of programming concepts that will help you the most (according to the 80/20 rule), and reviewing them using spaced repetition, you\u2019ll maximize your retention with minimal effort. This approach ensures that the most important concepts stick with you long-term while avoiding wasted time on less impactful material.</p>"},{"location":"#this-strategy-keeps-your-learning-efficient-focused-and-sustainable-ensuring-that-you-retain-only-the-most-useful-knowledge-over-time","title":"This strategy keeps your learning efficient, focused, and sustainable, ensuring that you retain only the most useful knowledge over time.","text":""},{"location":"#others","title":"Others","text":"<p>The 80/20 Principle (Pareto Principle) is a great starting point, but there are several other frameworks and strategies that can help optimize learning in programming or any new framework.

Here are the key reasons why Base64 is often used and how it works in simple terms:</p> <p>Why Base64?</p> <ul> <li> <p>Text-Based Transfer: HTTP and many other protocols are designed to handle text data efficiently. Binary data, such as images, PDFs, or other files, can include byte sequences that are not safe for text-based protocols. Base64 converts binary data into a text string composed of ASCII characters, making it safe to transmit over text-based protocols.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consistency: When sending data in text form, you avoid issues with character encoding that might corrupt the data. Base64 ensures that the data remains intact during transmission.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compatibility: Many systems and APIs expect data to be in a text format, especially when sending it in JSON objects. Base64 allows you to embed binary data within JSON objects easily.</p> </li> </ul> <p>How Base64 Works</p> <ul> <li> <p>Encoding: The binary data (such as the contents of a file) is divided into chunks of 3 bytes (24 bits). Each chunk is then split into four groups of 6 bits each. These 6-bit groups are then mapped to a set of 64 characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /).</p> </li> <li> <p>Padding: If the total number of bytes isn't divisible by 3, the encoder adds padding (usually \"=\") to make it up to a multiple of 4 characters.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decoding: The receiver reverses the process by converting the Base64 text back into the original binary data.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Backend: Encode and Send File Data</p> <p>Here's a simplified example in Node.js using Express:</p> <pre><code>const express = require('express');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get('/download', (req, res) =&gt; {\n    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'files', 'image.png'); // Path to your file\n    const fileName = 'image.png'; // File name to be sent\n\n    // Read the file and encode it to base64\n    fs.readFile(filePath, (err, data) =&gt; {\n        if (err) {\n            return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to read file', details: err.message });\n        }\n\n        const base64data = data.toString('base64');\n        res.json({ fileName, fileType: 'image/png', fileData: base64data });\n    });\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Frontend: Decode and Save File Data</p> <p>Here's a React component to fetch the file data, decode it, and save it:</p> <pre><code>import React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nconst FileDownload = () =&gt; {\n    const [file, setFile] = useState(null);\n\n    const handleFileDownload = () =&gt; {\n        fetch('http://localhost:3000/download')\n            .then(response =&gt; response.json())\n            .then(data =&gt; {\n                const { fileName, fileType, fileData } = data;\n\n                // Decode base64 string to binary data\n                const binaryString = atob(fileData);\n                const len = binaryString.length;\n                const bytes = new Uint8Array(len);\n                for (let i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {\n                    bytes[i] = binaryString.charCodeAt(i);\n                }\n\n                // Create a blob from the binary data\n                const blob = new Blob([bytes], { type: fileType });\n\n                // Create a link element to download the file\n                const link = document.createElement('a');\n                link.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n                link.download = fileName;\n                document.body.appendChild(link);\n                link.click();\n                document.body.removeChild(link);\n\n                setFile({ fileName, fileType, fileData });\n            })\n            .catch(error =&gt; {\n                console.error('Error downloading file:', error);\n            });\n    };\n\n    return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n            &lt;button onClick={handleFileDownload}&gt;Download File&lt;/button&gt;\n            {file &amp;&amp; &lt;p&gt;File downloaded: {file.fileName}&lt;/p&gt;}\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n};\n\nexport default FileDownload;\n</code></pre> <p>Summary</p> <ul> <li>Base64 Encoding: Converts binary data to a safe text format for transmission.</li> <li>Backend: Reads the file, encodes it to Base64, and sends it in a JSON response.</li> <li>Frontend: Fetches the Base64 data, decodes it, creates a Blob, and triggers a file download.</li> </ul> <p>This method ensures that you can safely send and receive file data without worrying about binary data corruption or compatibility issues with text-based protocols.</p> <p>Tip</p> <ul> <li>Binary Encoding: Represents data directly as bits without additional encoding, suitable for raw data storage and transmission.</li> <li>Base64 Encoding: Converts binary data into a text-based format using a set of 64 characters, commonly used for embedding binary data in text-based protocols.</li> <li>Binary Formats: Structured data serialization formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers, MessagePack) that encode data into efficient binary representations for performance and size benefits.</li> <li>Gzip Compression: Reduces the size of data by finding repeated patterns and replacing them with references, optimizing data transmission over networks.</li> </ul> Tip <p>The \"best\" method for sending data in an API response depends heavily on the specific requirements and constraints of your application. Here are a few considerations and methods commonly used in API design:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Direct Binary Transfer (Preferred for Large Files):</p> <ul> <li>Method: Instead of encoding binary data (like images, documents) into Base64 and embedding it within JSON/XML, you can directly transfer the binary data.</li> <li>Advantages: Reduces payload size since Base64 encoding increases data size by about 33%. Improves performance and reduces complexity on both server and client sides.</li> <li>Implementation: Use HTTP content types (multipart/form-data for form-based uploads or application/octet-stream for raw binary) to handle file uploads efficiently.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Base64 Encoding (Preferred for Small Binary Data within JSON/XML):</p> <ul> <li>Method: Encode binary data (e.g., images) into Base64 and embed it as a string within JSON or XML.</li> <li>Advantages: Ensures compatibility with text-based protocols. Allows transmission of binary data where direct binary transfer isn't feasible (e.g., in some JSON APIs). Considerations: Increased payload size and additional processing overhead for encoding and decoding Base64 data.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>URLs for Large Files (Optional):</p> <ul> <li>Method: Instead of embedding large files in API responses, return URLs where the files can be accessed or downloaded.</li> <li>Advantages: Reduces API response size. Allows efficient handling of large files by offloading storage and bandwidth requirements to a dedicated file server or CDN. Implementation: Ensure URLs are secure (e.g., using tokens or permissions) and accessible by API consumers.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Choosing the Best Method:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Payload Size: Consider the size of the data being transmitted. For small files or binary data snippets, Base64 might be acceptable. For larger files, direct binary transfer or URLs are typically more efficient.</p> </li> <li> <p>Performance: Evaluate the impact on network bandwidth, server load, and client-side processing. Direct binary transfer generally offers better performance compared to Base64 encoding, especially for large files.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compatibility: Ensure the chosen method is compatible with your client applications and any constraints they might have (e.g., browser support for file uploads or handling Base64).</p> </li> <li> <p>Security: Always prioritize security when transmitting sensitive data. Use HTTPS for secure communication and consider access controls for URLs or direct binary transfers.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In conclusion, the \"best\" method often involves a trade-off between payload size, performance, compatibility, and security considerations. Direct binary transfer is generally preferred for large files, while Base64 encoding within JSON/XML can be suitable for smaller binary data.

When you generate an SSH key pair, it consists of a public key (which is shared with servers) and a private key (which should be kept secure on your machine). The private key is often encrypted with a passphrase for an additional layer of security.</p> <p>The SSH agent allows you to load your private key into memory, eliminating the need to enter the passphrase each time you connect to a remote server. This enhances security by avoiding the risk of exposing the passphrase while making the authentication process more seamless.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing Multiple SSH Keys</p> <p>In a professional or personal setting, individuals often work with multiple SSH keys, especially when dealing with various accounts or projects. The SSH agent simplifies the management of these keys by allowing you to add multiple keys and choose which one to use for a particular connection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoiding Key Exhaustion</p> <p>SSH clients typically limit the number of authentication attempts in a given time frame. Without an SSH agent, each connection attempt may consume an authentication attempt, leading to temporary lockouts. The agent helps prevent key exhaustion by handling authentication efficiently.</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["Programming","SSH"]},{"location":"blog/2024/01/23/understanding-the-ssh-agent-why-it-matters-in-managing-ssh-keys/#how-to-start-the-ssh-agent","title":"How to Start the SSH Agent","text":"<p>To start the SSH agent, use the following command:</p> bash<pre><code>eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n</code></pre> <p>This command initializes the agent and prints environment variables to set up the agent's connection to the shell.</p>","tags":["Programming","SSH"]},{"location":"blog/2024/01/23/understanding-the-ssh-agent-why-it-matters-in-managing-ssh-keys/#adding-keys-to-the-ssh-agent","title":"Adding Keys to the SSH Agent","text":"<p>Once the agent is running, you can add your SSH keys using the <code>ssh-add</code> command.

Because they are disconnected, it takes some time for you to remember those things when you need them. And once you recover one memory, it does not help you recover other memories.

This is because riding a bicycle is not knowledge; it\u2019s a skill. An effective way to think about skills is that they are collections of memories that are connected to each other. Once you recover one of those memories, they all come together and are accessed in a much faster way by your brain.</p> <p>That is why, once you acquire the skill, you just sit on the bicycle and go. You do not need to remember each fact about riding a bike. It just comes to you, without effort. The most important thing about skills for you to keep in mind is that although you can acquire knowledge by reading or listening, you can only develop skills by doing. There is no amount of reading, listening, watching videos, or following amazing tutorials that will ever get you to ride a bicycle. The only way is to go down to the park and try, fall, try again, and eventually, do it.</p> <p>This is the same for every developer skill that you want to master. To really learn something, you must do things, instead of simply studying to acquire the knowledge.</p> <p>When you write your CV or resume or prepare your LinkedIn profile, do you list in it all the books you read and YouTube videos you watched? Do you list all the knowledge you have?

Each has its own advantages depending on your specific needs. Here's a breakdown to help you decide:</p> 1. Firebase (Firestore + Firebase Realtime Database)2. Django + WebSockets (Django Channels) <p>Firebase is a real-time, scalable, and managed backend solution that provides out-of-the-box real-time database functionality, which makes it a popular choice for chat apps.</p> <p>Advantages of Firebase:</p> <ul> <li>Real-time Database: Firebase Realtime Database and Firestore are built for real-time synchronization, which is ideal for chat features.</li> <li>Built-in Authentication: Firebase has easy-to-use authentication (Google, Facebook, Twitter, email, etc.), which is a huge plus for user management in a chat app.</li> <li>Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) provides push notifications for new messages when the app is in the background.</li> <li>Scalability: Firebase scales easily without you needing to manage servers.</li> <li>Cross-Platform Support: You can use Firebase across iOS, Android, and the web seamlessly.</li> </ul> <p>Disadvantages of Firebase:</p> <ul> <li>Vendor Lock-in: You\u2019re tied to Firebase\u2019s ecosystem.</li> <li>Pricing: Firebase has a free tier, but real-time databases and scaling can become costly as your app grows.</li> <li>Limited Backend Customization: Firebase provides limited server-side logic customization compared to traditional backends.</li> </ul> <p>Best for:</p> <ul> <li>Fast, easy setup for real-time chat.</li> <li>When you don\u2019t want to manage a custom backend or server infrastructure.</li> <li>Small to medium-sized apps, especially if you plan on scaling quickly.</li> </ul> How to Implement Chat in Firebase: <ol> <li> <p>Set up Firebase in React Native: Install Firebase SDK and configure your app:</p> <pre><code>npm install --save @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/firestore\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Real-time Chat Messaging using Firestore:</p> <p>You can use Firestore's real-time updates feature to listen for new messages and update the UI instantly.</p> <pre><code>import firestore from '@react-native-firebase/firestore';\n\n// To send a message:\nconst sendMessage = async (chatRoomId, message) =&gt;

Firebase provides this out-of-the-box, while Django Channels requires setting up WebSocket connections.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scalability: If you\u2019re building a large-scale app that needs to scale quickly, Firebase can handle scaling automatically. With Django, you\u2019ll need to manage server scaling manually.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cost: Firebase offers a free tier, but costs can rise quickly as your user base grows. Django hosting can be cheaper in the long run, but it requires more management.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ease of Use: Firebase is easier to set up for real-time features, especially if you're starting from scratch.

The Theory Behind WebSockets","text":"<p>WebSockets were designed to overcome the limitations of HTTP by enabling full-duplex communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. They allow the server to push data to the client as soon as it's available, without the client needing to ask for updates repeatedly.</p> Key Concepts of WebSockets: <ul> <li>Full-duplex: WebSockets allow both the client and server to send messages to each other at any time. This is what \"bidirectional\" means: either side can initiate communication.</li> <li>Persistent connection: Unlike HTTP, WebSockets keep the connection open after the initial handshake, allowing continuous communication without the overhead of re-establishing a new connection.</li> <li>Low-latency communication: Because the connection is kept open, messages are sent and received almost instantly, making it suitable for real-time applications.</li> </ul> How WebSockets Work: <ol> <li> <p>Initial Handshake: WebSockets start as an HTTP connection. The client sends an HTTP request to initiate the WebSocket protocol, using a special header:</p> <pre><code>GET /chat HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nUpgrade: websocket\nConnection: Upgrade\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>Upgrade: websocket</code> header tells the server that the client wants to switch from HTTP to WebSockets. If the server supports WebSockets, it responds with:</p> <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols\nUpgrade: websocket\nConnection: Upgrade\n</code></pre> <p>Once this handshake is complete, the connection switches from HTTP to WebSocket, and the connection remains open.</p> </li> <li> <p>Message Frames: After the handshake, data is sent over the WebSocket in small units called frames. These frames can carry text, binary data, or control information.</p> <ul> <li>Text Frames: For sending messages in a text format (e.g., JSON).</li> <li>Binary Frames: For sending binary data (e.g., images, files).</li> <li>Ping/Pong Frames: Keep the connection alive by checking whether the other side is still connected.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Real-Time Communication: Once the connection is established, both the client and server can send messages to each other without needing to re-establish a connection.

Why HTTP Alone Can't Do Bidirectional Communication","text":"<p>HTTP was designed for a request-response pattern. The inherent problem with HTTP for bidirectional communication is that it is unidirectional by nature:</p> <ul> <li>Client-driven: The client always initiates the request, and the server can only respond to the client\u2019s request. This means the server can't push data to the client unless the client asks for it.</li> <li>Connection overhead: Each time the client makes a request, it needs to establish a new connection, which is slow and inefficient for real-time communication.</li> <li>No event-driven communication: Since HTTP doesn't keep the connection open, there's no way for the server to notify the client of new events (e.g., new messages in a chat) without the client asking for updates.</li> </ul> <p>To simulate real-time communication over HTTP, developers use techniques like:</p> <ul> <li>Polling: The client repeatedly sends requests at regular intervals to check if there's new data (e.g., every second). This is inefficient and puts a heavy load on the server.</li> <li>Long Polling: The client sends a request, and the server holds the connection open until new data is available. The server responds once new data arrives, and the client immediately sends another request. This reduces the number of requests but still has latency issues.</li> <li>Server-Sent Events (SSE): This allows the server to push updates to the client over a single, one-way HTTP connection.

This contrasts with imperative programming, where you would manually manipulate the DOM to achieve the desired UI.</p> </li> <li> <p>Example: In React, you write something like <code>return &lt;div&gt;{count}&lt;/div&gt;</code> to declare that the UI should display the value of <code>count</code>, and React automatically updates the DOM when <code>count</code> changes.</p> </li> </ul> Functional Programming in React: <ul> <li> <p>Pure Functions: React components, especially functional components, are encouraged to be pure functions\u2014taking props as input and returning UI as output without side effects.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hooks: React hooks like <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> introduce functional programming concepts into React components, enabling you to manage state and side effects in a functional style.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Why React is Both Declarative and Functional:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Declarative: React\u2019s declarative nature comes from how you define the UI. You describe what the UI should look like based on the state, without worrying about how React will update the DOM to match.</p> </li> <li> <p>Functional: React's functional aspects allow you to structure components as pure functions, making your code more predictable, testable, and easier to reason about.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Summary:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Pure Functional: Haskell, Elm\u2014strictly follow functional programming principles with no room for imperative code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pure Declarative: SQL, HTML\u2014strictly focus on declaring the desired outcome without describing the process.</p> </li> <li> <p>React: Declarative in UI definition and functional in component structure, making it both declarative and functional but not purely one or the other.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tools/intro/#question-2","title":"Question 2","text":"Here\u2019s a pure declarative example using SQL, which is a purely declarative language. <p>Example: SQL Query</p> <pre><code>SELECT name, age\nFROM Users\nWHERE age &gt; 30\nORDER BY name ASC;\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>What: This SQL query specifies what data to retrieve from the database\u2014namely, the name and age of users who are older than 30.</li> <li>Not How: The query does not specify how the database should retrieve, filter, or sort the data. The SQL engine decides the optimal way to execute the query.</li> </ul> <p>Characteristics of Pure Declarative Code in This Example:</p> <ul> <li>No Control Flow: The query doesn't contain loops, conditionals, or instructions on how to traverse the data. It simply declares the desired outcome.</li> <li>Focus on Outcome: You express the result you want, and the system handles the underlying process.</li> </ul> <p>Another Example: HTML</p> <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Website&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a simple paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre> Explanation: <ul> <li>What: The HTML code declares what the structure of the webpage should be\u2014a heading followed by a paragraph.</li> <li>Not How: It doesn\u2019t specify how the browser should render the text, only what should be rendered.</li> </ul> Characteristics of Pure Declarative Code in This Example: <ul> <li>Structure Definition: The HTML only defines the structure and content of the page.</li> <li>No Behavior Control: There\u2019s no control over how the rendering process happens; that\u2019s handled by the browser.</li> </ul> <p>These examples illustrate how purely declarative code focuses entirely on what the desired outcome should be, leaving the underlying system or engine to figure out how to achieve it.</p>"},{"location":"tools/intro/#question-3","title":"Question 3","text":"then how react control flow <p>React, while declarative in nature, does allow for controlling flow within components through JavaScript logic. However, this control flow happens within the functional or class-based components, not at the level of the UI declaration itself. Here\u2019s how React handles control flow:</p> 1. Conditional Rendering <ul> <li> <p>If Statements:</p> <pre><code>function MyComponent({ isLoggedIn }) {\n    if (isLoggedIn) {\n        return &lt;h1&gt;Welcome back!&lt;/h1&gt;;\n    } else {\n        return &lt;h1&gt;Please sign in.&lt;/h1&gt;;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>Explanation:</p> <p>You use an if statement to control which part of the UI should be rendered based on the isLoggedIn prop. This is imperative logic within a declarative UI structure.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Ternary Operator:</p> <pre><code>function MyComponent({ isLoggedIn }) {\n    return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n            {isLoggedIn ? &lt;h1&gt;Welcome back!&lt;/h1&gt; : &lt;h1&gt;Please sign in.&lt;/h1&gt;}\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>Explanation:</p> <p>The ternary operator is another way to control flow within a React component. It\u2019s a more concise way to handle conditional rendering.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> 2. Looping Constructs <ul> <li> <p>Array.map():</p> <pre><code>function ItemList({ items }) {\n    return (\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n        {items.map(item =&gt; (\n            &lt;li key={item.id}&gt;{item.name}&lt;/li&gt;\n        ))}\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    );\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>Explanation:</p> <p>React uses JavaScript\u2019s array methods like <code>.map()</code> to iterate over items and render a list. This is a form of control flow that determines how many <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements will be rendered based on the <code>items</code> array.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> 3. Event Handling <ul> <li> <p>onClick Events:</p> <pre><code>function MyButton() {\n    function handleClick() {\n        alert('Button clicked!');\n    }\n    return &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>Explanation:</p> <p>React controls what happens when a user interacts with the UI using event handlers. Here, the <code>handleClick</code> function runs when the button is clicked, introducing a controlled response to user interaction.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>How This Fits into Declarative Paradigm:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Declarative UI Definition: The core of React is still declarative\u2014you're describing what the UI should look like for a given state. When state changes, React automatically updates the UI.</p> </li> <li> <p>Control Flow Inside Components: React allows you to embed imperative control flow (like <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>loops</code>, etc.) within the component functions to determine how the UI should be constructed. This is where the functional programming aspects of React come into play.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Summary:</p> <ul> <li>React provides a declarative way to define UI components but allows for controlled, imperative logic within those components to manage control flow, event handling, and conditional rendering. This combination of declarative UI with embedded control logic is what makes React both powerful and flexible.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tools/intro/#question-4","title":"Question 4","text":"so basically react is not pure, it is mix of everything <p>Yes, that's correct! React is not purely declarative or purely functional\u2014it\u2019s a hybrid that combines elements from various paradigms, making it both versatile and practical for modern web development. Here's a breakdown:</p> Mixed Paradigms in React <ol> <li> <p>Declarative UI:</p> <ul> <li>Declarative Nature: React allows you to describe what the UI should look like based on the current state. This is the core of React's declarative approach.</li> <li>Example: JSX syntax, where you declare what the UI should render.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Functional Programming:</p> <ul> <li>Functional Components: React encourages writing components as functions, especially with the introduction of hooks, promoting immutability and pure functions.</li> <li>Example: Functional components with hooks like <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Imperative Logic:</p> <ul> <li>Control Flow: Within components, you can use traditional imperative logic, such as if-else statements, loops, and event handlers, to control the flow and behavior of the application.</li> <li>Example: Conditional rendering, event handling, and side effects within components.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Component-Based Architecture:</p> <ul> <li>Reusability: React's component-based model allows for encapsulating behavior and UI into reusable, self-contained units.</li> <li>Example: Creating reusable components like buttons, forms, or complex UIs.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</p> <ul> <li>Class Components: While React is moving towards functional components, class-based components are still used and rely on OOP principles like inheritance and methods.</li> <li>Example: <code>class MyComponent extends React.Component {}</code>.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> Why This Mix is Beneficial: <ul> <li> <p>Flexibility: By mixing paradigms, React gives developers the flexibility to use the right tool for the job. You can use declarative UI definitions with functional or imperative logic depending on what makes the most sense for a particular task.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ease of Learning: React's declarative approach makes it easier to understand and reason about UI, while its support for imperative logic and functional components allows for powerful and flexible coding patterns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Performance: The combination of paradigms allows React to be both performant and developer-friendly, enabling optimizations like virtual DOM diffing while maintaining a straightforward development model.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Conclusion:</p> <p>React\u2019s strength lies in its ability to blend different programming paradigms \u2014 declarative, functional, imperative, and component-based \u2014 into a cohesive framework. This mix makes it adaptable to a wide range of use cases, from simple UI components to complex, interactive web applications.</p>"},{"location":"tools/intro/#question-5","title":"Question 5","text":"so all the language have imperative pardigm <p>Yes, almost all programming languages support the imperative paradigm because it forms the foundational model of how computers execute code. The imperative paradigm is deeply embedded in the way processors work\u2014executing instructions sequentially, manipulating memory, and using control structures to determine the flow of execution.</p> <p>Key Points:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Imperative Core: At a low level, all programming languages boil down to imperative instructions, as this is how hardware operates\u2014executing one instruction after another.</p> </li> <li> <p>Versatility: Most languages, even those that primarily support other paradigms (like functional or object-oriented), still allow imperative programming because it's versatile and essential for many tasks.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Examples of Languages Supporting Imperative Paradigm:</p> <ul> <li> <p>C/C++: Primarily imperative, with direct control over memory and hardware.</p> </li> <li> <p>Python: While Python supports multiple paradigms (imperative, object-oriented, and functional), it's often used imperatively, with loops, conditionals, and mutable state.</p> </li> <li> <p>Java: Object-oriented at its core, but imperative in how methods and loops are structured.</p> </li> <li> <p>JavaScript: Often used imperatively, especially in scripts manipulating the DOM or handling events.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ruby: Supports multiple paradigms but often used imperatively for scripting and procedural tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Assembly Language: The most direct form of imperative programming, where every instruction corresponds to a specific machine operation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Hybrid Nature of Modern Languages:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Multi-Paradigm Languages: Most modern languages are multi-paradigm, meaning they support imperative programming alongside other paradigms like functional, object-oriented, or declarative. This makes them flexible and powerful, allowing developers to choose the best approach for a given problem.</p> </li> <li> <p>Example: JavaScript is a good example. You can write imperative code with loops and conditionals, use functional programming with first-class functions and higher-order functions, or even take a declarative approach with libraries like React.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Why Imperative is Universal:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Historical Roots: Imperative programming is one of the oldest paradigms, closely aligned with the von Neumann architecture that underpins most computer systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ease of Understanding: It's intuitive because it mirrors how we think about processes\u2014do this, then do that.</p> </li> <li> <p>Control: It provides fine-grained control over what the computer is doing at each step, which is essential for performance-critical applications like system programming, real-time processing, and game development.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Summary:</p> <p>While languages may prioritize different paradigms (e.g., <code>functional</code> in Haskell, object-oriented in <code>Java</code>), they almost always include support for imperative programming because it aligns closely with how computers execute tasks.

This can be a full-screen video or a smaller video contained within the hero section. Video backgrounds can be particularly engaging and can help convey a brand's message effectively.</p> <p>3. Text-Centric Hero Section: In this type of hero section, the focus is on the text rather than the background image or video. The text may include a catchy headline, a brief description, and a call-to-action button. The background could be a solid color, a gradient, or a subtle pattern.</p> <p>4. Product Showcase Hero Section: If the website is focused on showcasing products or services, the hero section might feature a carousel or grid of images displaying the featured products or services. This type of hero section is common in e-commerce websites.</p> <p>5. Interactive Hero Section: An interactive hero section encourages user engagement through elements like sliders, interactive maps, or animations triggered by user actions. It's a more dynamic approach to the hero section, providing an immersive experience for visitors.</p> <p>6. Minimalist Hero Section: This type of hero section uses simple design elements, such as a single background image with minimal text and no distractions. It's clean, elegant, and allows the content to speak for itself.</p> <p>7. Illustrated Hero Section: Instead of using photographs or videos, this hero section features illustrations or graphics as the main visual element. It's a creative and unique approach that can help establish a brand's personality.</p> <p>8. Split-Screen Hero Section: In a split-screen hero section, the screen is divided into two sections, often with contrasting colors or images on each side. This design technique can be used to showcase two different aspects of a brand or to provide a visual comparison.</p> <p>These are just a few examples of the types of hero sections used in web design. The choice of hero section depends on factors such as the website's purpose, target audience, branding guidelines, and design preferences.</p> <p>Reference</p> <ul> <li>Impress your visitors: 6 tips for a perfect hero section</li> <li>The 4 types of hero images</li> <li>Landing Page Hero Shots</li> <li>What should a hero section have?</li> <li>8 creative ways to design your hero section</li> <li>What is a hero image?</li> </ul> <ul> <li>smashing magazine</li> <li>svg doodle arrow</li> </ul> <p>Abstract</p> <p>https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/shell-windows-switching.html.en</p> <p>https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface</p>"},{"location":"tools/git/resource/#react","title":"react","text":"<p>The Ultimate Guide to Implementing React Debounce Effectively</p> <p>Implement Debouncing in React in 3 Different Ways</p> <p>Debouncing in React \u2013 How to Delay a JS Function</p> <p>Tip</p> <pre><code>from django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.urls import reverse\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>django context preprocessor</li> <li>How to create and use custom context processors in django?</li> <li>How To Create Custom Context Processors in Django </li> <li>Writing a Custom Template Context Processor in Django</li> <li>Context Processors in Django </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tools/git/resource/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<ul> <li>How To Save And Restore Tmux Environments Across Reboots In Linux</li> <li>Restore tmux session after reboot</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tools/git/resource/#bem","title":"BEM","text":"<p>CSS Naming Conventions</p> <p>BEM, which stands for Block, Element, Modifier, is a popular CSS naming convention that helps developers write more maintainable and modular CSS. It provides a structured way of naming CSS classes to make styles more predictable and easier to understand.</p> <pre><code>&lt;div class=\"block\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"block__element\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"block__element--modifier\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> <pre><code>.block { /* block styles */ }\n.block__element { /* element styles */ }\n.block__element--modifier { /* modifier styles */ }\n</code></pre> <p>Here's a brief overview of BEM:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Block:</p> <p>A standalone component that is meaningful on its own. It represents a higher-level component or a module on the page.</p> <p>Blocks represent standalone entities or components on a web page. They are the top-level abstraction and should be independent, reusable pieces of UI. Examples could be headers, footers, navigation bars, cards, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Element:</p> <p>A part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block. Elements are typically children of blocks and are named with double underscores (<code>__</code>) following the block name.</p> <p>Elements are parts of blocks and cannot exist outside of a block. They are semantically tied to the block they belong to and represent smaller components within that block. For example, within a card block, elements could include the card title, card content, card footer, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modifier:</p> <p>A flag on a block or element that changes its appearance or behavior. Modifiers are named with double hyphens (<code>--</code>) following the block or element name.</p> <p>Modifiers are flags on blocks or elements that alter their appearance or behavior. They allow for variations of a block or element without duplicating code. For example, a modifier could change the color, size, or state (such as active, inactive, etc.) of a block or element.</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>The philosophy behind BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) styling is to create a modular and reusable structure for CSS classes, enhancing maintainability, and reducing the risk of style conflicts in larger projects.</p> <pre><code>&lt;section class=\"main-section\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"block1\"&gt;\n    &lt;h2 class=\"block1__title\"&gt;Block 1 Title&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p class=\"block1__description\"&gt;Description for Block 1&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;button class=\"block1__button\"&gt;Button 1&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class=\"block2\"&gt;\n    &lt;h2 class=\"block2__title\"&gt;Block 2 Title&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p class=\"block2__description\"&gt;Description for Block 2&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;button class=\"block2__button\"&gt;Button 2&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tools/git/resource/#reference_1","title":"Reference","text":"<ul> <li>What is BEM?

These workflows can include steps like running tests, building applications, deploying code, and more.</p> Why Do We Need GitHub Actions? <p>GitHub Actions helps streamline the development process by automating repetitive tasks, which can improve efficiency and reduce the likelihood of errors. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s valuable:</p> <ol> <li>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automate testing and deployment processes to ensure code changes are automatically tested and deployed without manual intervention.</li> <li>Consistency: Ensure that all developers follow the same processes, reducing variability in how code is built, tested, and deployed.</li> <li>Efficiency: Save time by automating routine tasks like code linting, formatting, or even generating documentation.</li> <li>Integration: Easily integrate with other services and tools within the GitHub ecosystem, such as code reviews and issue tracking.</li> </ol> Problems GitHub Actions Solves <ol> <li>Manual Errors: By automating processes, you reduce the risk of human error that can occur with manual deployments or testing.</li> <li>Time Consumption: Automation speeds up repetitive tasks, such as running test suites or building projects, which can otherwise be time-consuming.</li> <li>Consistency in Workflows: Ensures that every code push or pull request goes through the same automated processes, which improves the reliability and quality of your code.</li> </ol> When to Use GitHub Actions <ol> <li>Automating Tests: Automatically run unit tests, integration tests, and other types of tests when code changes are pushed or pull requests are made.</li> <li>Building Projects: Automate the build process for different environments or configurations, ensuring that your application can be built correctly.</li> <li>Deployment: Automatically deploy code to production, staging, or other environments upon successful builds or other criteria.</li> <li>Code Quality: Implement code quality checks, such as linting or style checking, to ensure that code adheres to predefined standards.</li> <li>Documentation: Automatically generate or update documentation as part of your workflow.</li> </ol> When Not to Use GitHub Actions <ol> <li>Simple Repositories: If your repository is small and doesn\u2019t require automated workflows, setting up GitHub Actions might be overkill.</li> <li>Highly Sensitive Data: For workflows that involve sensitive data or require highly secure environments, additional considerations might be needed to ensure that secrets and sensitive information are managed securely.</li> <li>Performance Concerns: For extremely resource-intensive tasks, you might need to evaluate if GitHub Actions\u2019 performance meets your needs or if other CI/CD tools are more appropriate.</li> <li>Complex Configuration: If you have very complex or specialized workflows, it might require a steep learning curve or might be better suited for other CI/CD tools with more advanced capabilities.</li> </ol> <p>In summary, GitHub Actions is a versatile tool for automating tasks and workflows within your GitHub projects, making it easier to maintain code quality and streamline development processes.
